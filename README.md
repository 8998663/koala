## Koala

Koala is a python module to replace excel formulas. Koala parses an Excel workbook and creates an AST network of all the needed formula. It is then possible to change any value of a cell and recompute the depending cells.

This project is a "double fork" of two awesome projects:
- [Pycel](https://github.com/dgorissen/pycel), a python module that generates AST graph from a workbook
- [OpenPyXL](http://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/default/), a full API able to read/write/manipulate Excel 2010 files


This module has been enriched by [Ants](http://WeAreAnts.fr), but is part of a more global project of [Engie](http://www.engie.com/) company and particularly it Center of Expertise in Modelling and Economics Studies.
